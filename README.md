# Pomodoro

### General info

I've made pomodoro timer using Vanilla JS.
It was first time I've focused first on "Mobile first" design.
Webpage is also fully responsive.
You can set length of pomodoro, breaks and interval between short and long break.
When time is up - category and timer will change and start automatically.
